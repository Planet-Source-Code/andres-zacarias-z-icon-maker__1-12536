Z Icon Maker was made by Andres Zacarias.
This .ocx will let you make cool Icon Maker Aplications.

This is my firts version of it and has just one simple function.
Make Icons.


How to use this:

1.-There are two properties for this to function correctly:
   GetPath and SavePath.
2.-In GetPath you will give the path of were is the .bmp file or
   other image extension.
3.-Once you have made that the SavePath is for were you whant it to
   save the icon.


IMPORTANT:

When you give the both paths put there extension ( example .bmp )
(example .ico )


Thats all for the moment.
